This is a sanity check to make sure that the gpu version of the code (SpinXFormGPU) 
solves the same linear system with the original version of the code (SpinXForm) 
found at http://users.cms.caltech.edu/~keenan/src/spinxform_commandline.zip
at http://users.cms.caltech.edu/~keenan/project_spinxform.html .

The file 'final_sparse_matrix-in_COO_format.txt' encodes the structure of the 
sparse matrix in the final linear system to be solved and corresponds to the 
*original* code (SpinXForm) when the vertices of the 'sphere.obj' are deformed 
based on 'bumpy.tga'.

In SpinXFormGPU, if you uncomment 'cusp::io::write_matrix_market_file( W, "W.mtx" );' 
in QuaternionMatrix.cpp and then run SpinXFormGPU, you will get a 'W.mtx' matrix 
in the Matrix Market exchange format [1]. The structure of the matrix in the 
'W.mtx' and 'final_sparse_matrix-in_COO_format.txt' is identical (in fact, in the 
'W.mtx' matrix, rows indices, columns indices and values are shifted by 1, simply 
because the Matrix Market format uses 1-based indexing).

Also, in the 'final_sparse_matrix-in_COO_format' ignore the first digit in 
row/col/val and count in each row, they are only there for help me counting.
